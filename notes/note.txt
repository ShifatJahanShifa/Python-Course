** In other words, a script is a program that is short, simple, and can be written very quickly.
** Automation is the process of replacing a manual step with one that happens automatically.
** Automation can: It can save time, reduce errors, increase consistency, and provide a way to centralize solutions and mistakes, making them easier to fix.
** Python can also run on a variety of machines, such as servers, workstations, PCs, mobile devices, IoT, and more.

** Python is: 😍

a general purpose scripting language;

a popular language used to code a variety of applications;

a frequently used tool for automation;

a cross-platform compatible language;

a beginner-friendly language.

** Python is not: 

a platform-specific / OS-specific scripting language;

a client-side scripting language;

a purely object-oriented programming language.

** Client-side scripting language - Client-side scripting languages, like JavaScript, are used mostly for web programming. The scripts are transferred from a web server to the end-user’s internet browser, then executed in the browser.


** Order of operations
The order of operations are to be calculated from left to right in the following order:

 You might find the PEMDAS mnemonic device to be helpful in remembering the order.   
 
 
 ** In Python, text in between quotes -- either single or double quotes -- is a string data type. 
 ** explicit conversion - when code is written to manually convert one data type to another using a data type conversion function:

str() - converts a value (often numeric) to a string data type

int() - converts a value (usually a float) to an integer data type

float() - converts a value (usually an integer) to a float data type
